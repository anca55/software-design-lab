## Week 4 (2/14 to 2/21)

This week, I spent spent most of the time in trying to catch up with what I have been missing. Basically, I had to study the command line and the Git syntax in order to finally start exercising some Python. I realized things are not that simple though. 

The forth week was, therefore, mostly related to catching up with the command lines and how to push works to Git. 

Also, I had to catch up with the readings, which I find fascinating. 

## Week 5 (2/22 to 2/28)

This week, I finally managed to get my hands on "Learn Python the Hard Way", which I had been postponing for a long time. The main reason was that before that, I simply could not apply the advice and the lessons without knowing that I cannot ask for help if I get stuck. But I eventually managed to get rid of this stress and started working with it. 

I found it very useful for the first lessons of Python. Of course, I always reached out to Google whenever I found myself lost. But I have also discovered this is an important part of the process: don't give up after the first error, just keep on (calmly!) seeking for your mistakes, and be aware of the signals you get on the way. I do not know how programmers relate to that in the coding vocabulary, I'd just call it "proceed, don't freak out". 

Besides that, I was reading about pros and cons of static site generators and of Wordpress, which got me more analytical about my work.
